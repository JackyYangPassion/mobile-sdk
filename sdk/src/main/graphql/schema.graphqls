This scalar is a description of an exact instant on the timeline such as the instant that a user account was created.

This scalar ignores leap seconds (thereby assuming that a minute constitutes 59 seconds). In this respect, it diverges from the RFC 3339 profile.

Where an RFC 3339 compliant date-time string has a time-zone other than UTC, it is shifted to UTC. For example, the date-time string 2016-01-01T14:10:20+01:00 is shifted to 2016-01-01T13:10:20Z.
